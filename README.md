### IMPORTANT:
- Language allowed is English only. (It would be easier in the long run. In case there would be non Czech member of the team.)
- When creating a new issue:
  - Before creating a new issue, ask the lead of the Department for approval. (They are listed in the Department description in the README.) 
This way it will be clear what is supposed to be there and what is not. (Heads of Department has the best knowledge of what is needed to be addressed and what is not.)
  - Fill all the collumns. Add description if necessary. Assign a person / people to the task.
- When pushing a code, add there a description. Each function in the code should have a description of variables which is using. 
- Documentation of the functions / modules is required. (For the Phase Demo and further.)
