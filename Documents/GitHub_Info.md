# GitHub

🔶 Basic information:

-   🔷 GitHub is a version-based software capable of recovering work from
    the past.

-   🔷 It is highly recommended for use when working with a lot of code
    especially.

-   🔷 To start working with GitHub and adding your files, you need to
    download an app medium or terminal. Through these medium/terminals
    you will send commands for execution. (I recommend downloading
    **GitHub Desktop** application. (User interface is friendly and no
    direct command writing is required.))

-   🔷 GitHub project is called repository, it is a place where binary
    information is stored.

🔶 How to use repository:

-   🔷 If you have downloaded GitHub app or Terminal, you need to clone the
    repository and needed branch first.

-   ❗️ **BEWARE: You need to be careful which branch you are choosing to
    clone. If did incorrectly you could potentially destroy others'
    work!** ❗️

-   🔷 To clone the repository, you need the SSH key or HTTPS link to the
    repository.

-   🔷 Once inserted, choose the path on your PC, where the repository will
    be cloned. (❗️ IMPORTANT: Create a folder for the project otherwise all
    the folders and files in the selected folder will be uploaded into
    the project after committing and pushing. ❗️)

-   🔷 If you have successfully cloned your repository, you can add
    whatever file/folder you need.

-   🔷 To send the folders/file from your local folder into the GitHub
    cloud you need to first Commit the selected branch. After that you
    need to push the committed files, so they would be uploaded to
    GitHub. (❗️ IMPORTANT: Write a summary, which would tell others what is
    being committed. If necessary, you can add description. ❗️)
