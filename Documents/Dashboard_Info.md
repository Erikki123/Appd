**IMPORTANT:**

• Language allowed is English only. (It would be easier in the long
run.\
In case there would be non-Czech member of the team.)

• When creating a new issue:

> o Before creating a new issue, ask the lead of the Department for
> approval.\
> (They are listed in the Department description in the README.)\
> This way it will be clear what is supposed to be there and what is
> not. (Heads of Department has the best knowledge of what is needed to
> be addressed and what is not.)

o Fill all the columns. Add description if necessary. Assign a person /
people to the task.

• When pushing a code, add there a description.\
Each function in the code should have a description of variables which
is using.

• Documentation of the functions / modules is required. (For the Phase
Demo and further.)
