# Dashboard

**🔷 BASIC INFO:**

- 🔶 Dashboard of tasks, which needs to be completed.

- 🔶 Each member has an issue assigned with a description for better
understanding.

instead of tasks, because it is primarily created for programmers.) ❗️

- **🔶 PROJECT PHASE** - Shows to which phase the issue belongs.

  - 🔸 PROOF OF CONCEPT:

    - Testing all the ideas during this phase. (In every Department where it needs to be done.)
    - Presenting working ideas at the end of this phase.
    - All the ideas presented needs to be approved, before proceeding further.

  - 🔸 DEMO:

    - Implementing approved ideas and creating working pre-version of the project.
    - Bugs are acceptable and fully expected.
    - This phase is for assemble, testing and debugging of the approved ideas primarily.

  - 🔸 VERSION 1.0:

    - First version of fully working project.
    - Bugs and other issues are expected to appear.

**🔷 IMPORTANT:**

- 🔶 Language allowed is English only. (It would be easier in the long run. In case there would be non-Czech member of the team.)

- 🔶 When creating a new issue:

  - 🔸 Before creating a new issue, ask the lead of the Department for approval. (They are listed in the Department description in the README.)
This way it will be clear what is supposed to be there and what isnot. (Heads of Department has the best knowledge of what is needed to be addressed and what is not.)

  - 🔸 Fill all the columns. Add description if necessary. Assign a person people to the task.

  - 🔸 When pushing a code, add there a description. Each function in the code should have a description of variables which is using.

  - 🔸 Documentation of the functions / modules is required. (For the Phase Demo and further.)
