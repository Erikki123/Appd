# Branches

**ğŸ”¶ Basic information:**

-   ğŸ”· There are two main branches called main and dev.

-   ğŸ”· Those two branches are protected, that means that to merge to work
    from the child branch into this one, at least one member must
    approve the merge process. (It is due to the security and prevention
    of random merges.)

-   ğŸ”· All members are allowed to approve the merge. At least two will be
    required.

-   ğŸ”· Member or lead cannot approve himself / herself a merge.

**ğŸ”¶ Main types of branches:**

-   ğŸ”· Main branch:

    -   ğŸ”¹ Main branch is for the main milestones of the development.

    -   ğŸ”¹ From the main branch the final application will be released.

-   ğŸ”· Dev branch:

    -   ğŸ”¹ Branch dev is for merging the development progress of each
        member.

    -   ğŸ”¹ The development branch is separated, because there will be a
        higher number of commits. It makes the main branch cleaner.
